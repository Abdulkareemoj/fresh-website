        Hi there, I&apos;m <strong> Abdulkareem </strong> aka
        <strong> WiZtEk </strong>. I&apos;m a dude with intrests in
        <strong> building things, </strong>i guess i would describe myself as a
        fullstack developer/software engineer but thats because i like to
        understand all parts of a system to know how it works and if possible
        improve it. I enjoy <strong> game </strong> and{" "}
        <strong> web development </strong>
        and I use the <strong> terminal </strong> as much as i can.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now I&apos;m work ing at
        <strong>
          <a href="#" target="_blank">
            {" "}
            Nowhere{" "}
          </a>
        </strong>
        , building nothing.
